# Get started

We will guide you through the simple Installation process (not shire if this can be even called installation, because of how simple it is)

## Requirements

- PHP 5.4 or higher
- The GD extension installed (most PHP installations have this by default)
- (Optional: A cup of coffee ‚òïÔ∏è)

**Alternatively** you could use my [publicly hosted version](https://api.jm26.net/badge) of PHP-BADGES, but I would recommend hosting it yourself, as it is very simple to do so.

## Installation Steps

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/JMcrafter26/php-badges/releases/latest) page.
2. Extract the zip file and upload the `generate.php` from the `src` folder to your web server.
3. You're done! üéâ

### Basic Usage

#### First Visit

When you first visit the `generate.php` file in your browser, the font will be automatically downloaded for you.

To create a badge, simply add open the `generate.php` file in your browser.
By default, the badge will be created with the following settings:
- Icon: GitHub 
- Label: Documentation
- Message: go.jm26.net/badge-docs
- Color: green

(Instructions for changing the default settings can be found [here](./usage.html#default-settings))

#### Creating a Badge

I recommend using the [Badge Generator](https://test.jm26.net/badge-generator/) to create your badges, as it is much easier to use.

**Otherwise** to generate a badge with different settings, simply add the following query parameters to the URL:

- `icon` - The icon to use, Font Awesome icon unicode (e.g. `f09b` for GitHub). See [Icons](./usage.html#icons) for more info.
- `label` - The label text (left side) of the badge
- `message` - The message text (right side) of the badge
- `color` - The color of the badge (e.g. `green`, `red`, ok, important, ff69b4, etc.)
- (optional) `url` - The URL to an external json file to get the badge settings from (see [External JSON](./usage.html#url) for more info)
