# About the statistics

The statistics are open-source and available for everyone and **never collect/store any informations beside the use count of the script**.

That means we **do not** know who is using the script and what they are doing with it. We do not collect any personal informations and we *never* will.

## Where can I see the current use count?

The current use count can be seen here:

- as a badge: [https://api.jm26.net/badge/statistics?accuratecount=true](https://api.jm26.net/badge/statistics?accuratecount=true)

- Or here as blank text: [https://api.jm26.net/badge/count.txt](https://api.jm26.net/badge/count.txt)

## How does it work?

The script uses the [https://api.jm26.net/badge/statistics](https://api.jm26.net/badge/statistics) API to get the current use count and then adds 1 to it.

The API is a simple PHP script that stores the use count in a text file and returns it when requested.

## When is the use count updated?

The statistics are updated everytime the script is used.

## What do you do with hackers?

The short answer is: *nothing*.

**BUT** we do not like hackers and we do not want them to use our script.

**SO** if you are a hacker and you are using the script, please stop. This makes us very sad ‚òπÔ∏è

Please do not use the script in a loop or in a way that is designed to spam the API and increase the use count. - This will not result a ban (because we do not know who is using the script) but *it will make us very sad and we will not like you anymore* üò¢
